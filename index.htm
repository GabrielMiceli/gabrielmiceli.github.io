<h1>Gabriel Miceli's Webpage</h1>
<hr>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am Gabriel Miceli, a 20-year-old computer hobbyist and mathematician. I like to work on computers made in the early- to mid-2000s. I find that these computers have long lifespans and are the most compatible with both old and new software and hardware.</p><br>
<p>Here is a picture that I took in 2016 of my nine desktop computers (select to view full size - 1587177 bytes):</p>

<br>
<h2>Dotted Zeros</h2>
<p>When I write a zero, I always put a dot in the center of it so that it helps to differentiate it from the latin capital letter O or the Danish/Norwegian capital letter &Oslash; if the context of its usage is hard to get.<br><a style=font-size:72pt;line-height:0.9em>O 0 &Oslash;</a></p><br>

<h2>Regarding the Move from gabrielmiceli.ga</h2>
<p>I began experimenting with using GitHub's Pages platform to see how well it would work as a web host, and I reserved the name miceli.ga for it in hopes to use it as a permanent watermark in my videos that may be taken from YouTube, but I haven't touched it in a while, and Freenom stopped sending me renewal e-mails. I was lucky enough to have caught on and kept gabrielmiceli.ga, but miceli.ga had expired. I found out afterward that expired domain names registered with Freenom become "special", and they want to start charging 9.95 USD monthly to use it again, and if you haven't seen already, the paid portion of Freenom borders-on scammy behaviour. That's when it hit me that I should just stop using that domain name registrar and use what the web hosts that I use provide for me. It's such a shame because miceli.ga would have been a perfect domain name for my website, and no other domain name registrars will accept dot-ga TLDs. This brings us here to gabrielmiceli.github.io. I picked this for web hosting because I can code my webpages from scratch, it supports HTTPS with DigiCert, and there are no monthly renewals that Freenom and x10Host (well, at least x10Host used to) need. The only trade-off is the long domain name. I tried to fix this by changing the GitHub repository name and even my own username, but changing the repository name created a subpage instead, and GMiceli was taken already, so I just decided to accept the trade-off. After all, "Gabriel" is not all that hard to spell. I also decided to consolidate the only two pages I had into one because they didn't have much content, so dividing the two was pointless. Now hopefully, this page is here to stay permanently.</p><br>
